# SLURM

> **Standalone install?** If this session was not initialized by the TAO skill bank plugin, run the `tao-setup` skill first (host preflight, credentials, cross-skill discovery).

Remote GPU compute platform for clusters managed by SLURM. Jobs are submitted
from the launch host to a login node over SSH, staged on a shared
filesystem, submitted with `sbatch`, and executed with `srun` container support.

## When to use

Use SLURM when the user has access to a managed GPU cluster, shared Lustre
storage, and scheduler-owned GPU allocation. Do not use SLURM for local files
that exist only on the agent machine; data and outputs must be reachable from
the cluster.

## Preflight + SSH

Confirm `SLURM_USER` and `SLURM_HOSTNAME` are exported and passwordless SSH to a
login host works (`ssh -o BatchMode=yes`).
For private `nvcr.io` images, install `~/.config/enroot/.credentials` on the
cluster once per (cluster, user): Pyxis/Enroot does not read `NGC_KEY` from the
job env, and without persistent credentials, auth-gated pulls fail with "Could
not process JSON input" at job startup. Install it via the `printf | ssh`
heredoc so the `NGC_KEY` value never lands in shell history, intermediate files,
or chat output; never `cat`/`echo` the value.

If a preflight check fails, the agent prompts the user to authorize the
install/fix via Bash. Pip-installable Python requirements are the exception:
install them automatically, then rerun preflight.

See `references/slurm-ssh-credentials.md` for the full preflight script, the
enroot-credentials heredoc, prerequisite key setup (keypair, `ssh-copy-id`,
`known_hosts`, container key mounts, 2FA handling), and the SSH failure
remediation prompt.

## Execution — the four verbs

`tao-run-on-slurm` is a platform **consumer**: it runs a spec-bundle over
`ssh + sbatch/squeue/sacct/scancel`, mutating only the job-record. Storage is
**tier A** (Lustre) — the dataset is staged to a shared path *before* submit and
read through Pyxis; never fetch S3 inside the allocation (the scheduler-idle
timeout kills GPU-idle jobs and bills the wasted time). `$BANK` =
`${TAO_SKILL_BANK_PATH}`; `$LOGIN` = a resolved `SLURM_HOSTNAME`.

### submit

1. **Reuse what's already staged — never redo (tier A):**
   - *Image:* `@@IMAGE@@` is a Lustre `.sqsh` — **reuse an existing one if present**
     (`ssh $LOGIN ls <sqsh>`); only if missing, convert once with `enroot import`
     (cached by name — see `references/slurm-container-execution.md`).
   - *Dataset:* **confirm it is already on Lustre** (`ssh $LOGIN test -e …`) and
     reference those paths; `tao-data-io` stages *only* a small auxiliary input
     that is not there yet — never re-stage existing data, and never the training
     set inside the allocation.
   Then author the spec at `<job_dir>/specs/spec.yaml` on Lustre with those paths.
2. **Credentials → sidecar (never inline):** if the run needs session creds
   (e.g. `HF_TOKEN`), write them to a mode-600 sidecar on Lustre and let the
   template shred it on exit; NGC image pulls use the one-time
   `~/.config/enroot/.credentials` (see `references/slurm-ssh-credentials.md`),
   not the job env:
   ```bash
   ssh $LOGIN "umask 077; printf 'export HF_TOKEN=%s\n' \"\$HF_TOKEN\" > <job_dir>/job_$JOB_ID.env"
   ```
3. **Open the record — mints the id, binds `results_dir` on Lustre, before launch:**
   ```bash
   JOB_ID=$("$BANK/scripts/tao_job_record.py" open --platform slurm --image "$IMAGE" \
     --network-arch "$ARCH" --action "$ACTION" --storage-tier A --results-root "$SLURM_BASE_RESULTS_DIR")
   ```
4. **Render** `templates/slurm/singlenode.sbatch.tmpl` — substitute every
   `@@<NAME>@@` (`JOB_NAME=$JOB_ID`, `NUM_GPUS`, `CPUS_PER_TASK`, `TIME`, `LOG_DIR`,
   `IMAGE`, `CONTAINER_MOUNTS=/lustre`, `COMMAND=<bundle command reading the Lustre
   spec>`, `SBATCH_EXTRA=` account/partition lines, `ENV_FILE=` the sidecar path or
   empty, `EXTRA_ENV=` any cluster NCCL knobs) → `<job_dir>/sbatch/job_$JOB_ID.sbatch`.
   **Lint + syntax-check before submit:** `redact_secrets.py lint <sbatch>` must
   pass and `bash -n <sbatch>` must succeed.
5. **Submit + record RUNNING:**
   ```bash
   SLURM_ID=$(ssh $LOGIN "sbatch --parsable <job_dir>/sbatch/job_$JOB_ID.sbatch")
   "$BANK/scripts/tao_job_record.py" mark "$JOB_ID" --state RUNNING --backend-ref "$SLURM_ID"
   ```

A submit that skipped the gate or the open has no id — so it cannot launch.

### status

```bash
st=$(ssh $LOGIN "sacct -j $SLURM_ID -X -n -o State" | tr -d ' ')   # squeue while pending
```

| SLURM state | vocab |
|---|---|
| `PENDING` | `PENDING` |
| `RUNNING` / `COMPLETING` | `RUNNING` |
| `COMPLETED` | `COMPLETE` (confirm `status.json` in `results_dir`) |
| `FAILED` / `TIMEOUT` / `OUT_OF_MEMORY` | `ERROR` (infra-vs-program classify → retry, M6) |
| `NODE_FAIL` / `BOOT_FAIL` | `ERROR`, `err_class=ERR_INFRA` (`--requeue` re-queues these) |
| `CANCELLED` / `PREEMPTED` / `REVOKED` | `CANCELED` |
| (not found) | `UNKNOWN` |

Native sub-state rides in the transition `message`. Poll at the chosen interval;
long queue waits are normal — do not stop on elapsed time.

### logs

```bash
ssh $LOGIN "tail -n ${N:-200} <log_dir>/$JOB_ID-$SLURM_ID/main.out"   # SLURM auto-creates the %x-%j subdir
```

### cancel

```bash
ssh $LOGIN "scancel $SLURM_ID"
"$BANK/scripts/tao_job_record.py" mark "$JOB_ID" --state CANCELED --source agent
```

Treat an already-terminated SLURM job as a successful cancel.

### Multi-node (nodes > 1)

Same four verbs, with three additions at submit:

1. **Render `templates/slurm/multinode.sbatch.tmpl`** instead of the single-node
   one — it's a strict superset (adds `--nodes` / `--wait-all-nodes` + the
   rendezvous block). `WORLD_SIZE` is the **node count** (TAO's misnomer); never
   change it to a global-rank count.
2. **NCCL probe first** — before the real job, run a cheap 2-node all-reduce
   (`scripts/nccl_allreduce_probe.py` under the container's torchrun) with a
   ~120s timeout. `NCCL_PROBE_OK` → proceed. **Timed out** (the collective hung)
   → set the cluster's NCCL knob in `EXTRA_ENV` and re-probe — on CS-OCI-ORD that
   is `export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1` (the intra-node P2P hang), often with
   `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth0` / `NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1`. **Cache the working env per
   cluster** so later jobs skip the probe. Gate on **`gpus_per_node > 1` too** —
   the P2P hang triggers on a single node with 2+ GPUs.
3. Tier-A Lustre, sidecar creds, record, and lint are unchanged.

## Storage

Use shared-filesystem URIs, not local or `file://` paths; `tao-core` rejects
local/file paths for remote backends.

- `lustre:///absolute/path` for user-provided datasets on Lustre.
- `slurm://` paths may appear in microservices metadata and are converted to
  Lustre paths before the container starts.

Accept either dataset roots (model skills map them to required files) or direct
spec-key paths. After SSH succeeds and before generating scripts, `test -e` each
required dataset path from the login host; if it fails, stop and ask for
corrected paths or staged data rather than producing scripts that fail in the
first training job. See `references/slurm-ssh-credentials.md` for root vs.
direct-spec modes, backend details, and the results-dir default.

## Container execution

`tao-core` runs TAO containers through Pyxis/Enroot:

1. Stage compact JSON files for specs, environment, and cloud metadata under
   `<job_dir>/specs`, `<job_dir>/env`, and `<job_dir>/meta`.
2. Optionally convert the Docker image to a cached SQSH image with
   `srun -n1 -p <conversion_partition> enroot import`.
3. Write an sbatch script under `<job_dir>/sbatch/job_<job_id>.sbatch`.
4. Submit `sbatch --export=ALL <script>`.
5. Run the container with `srun --container-image=<image> --container-mounts=/lustre`.

Accepted image formats: `/path/to/image.sqsh`, `registry#image:tag`,
`docker://registry#image:tag`, and ordinary `registry/image:tag` (converted to
Pyxis form when needed). SQSH conversion is cached by image name; for `:latest`
images the cached SQSH is reused unless `force_reconvert_latest` is enabled.

## Monitoring and cancellation

- Scheduler status comes from the stored SLURM job id via `squeue`/`sacct`;
  TAO terminal status comes from `status.json` in the shared results folder.
- While chat monitoring is enabled, keep polling at the requested interval for
  any non-terminal job (`PENDING`, `RUNNING`, or otherwise). Do not stop after a
  fixed elapsed time such as 30 minutes; long queue waits are normal on shared
  GPU partitions.
- Do not send a final response for a non-terminal SLURM job when chat
  monitoring is enabled. A final response is a detach action; use it only if the
  user asked to detach/stop or the job reached terminal state.
- Logs are read over SSH from
  `<job_dir>/slurm-logs/<slurm_job_name>-<slurm_job_id>/main.out` and `.err`.
- Cancel by looking up `backend_details.slurm_metadata.slurm_job_id` and running
  `scancel <slurm_job_id>` over SSH. Treat missing or already terminated jobs as
  successful cancellation.

Status mapping:

- `PENDING` -> `Pending`
- `RUNNING` or `COMPLETING` -> `Running`
- `COMPLETED` -> check `status.json`
- `FAILED`, `BOOT_FAIL`, `DEADLINE`, `OUT_OF_MEMORY`, `NODE_FAIL` -> retry if
  logs match retriable infrastructure patterns, otherwise `Error`
- `CANCELLED`, `PREEMPTED`, `REVOKED` -> `Canceled`
- `TIMEOUT` -> `Error`
- `SUSPENDED`, `STOPPED` -> `Paused`

## Required inputs

Ask for these in the SLURM intake; see `references/slurm-ssh-credentials.md`
for the full credential list, microservices schema keys, and defaults.

- **SLURM_USER** (required): SSH username for the login node.
- **SLURM_HOSTNAME** (required): Comma-separated login hostnames for failover.
- **SLURM_PARTITION** (required): Partition list for GPU submission. Packaged
  default `polar,polar3,polar4,grizzly`, treated as 4-hour queues.
- **SSH_KEY_PATH** (preferred, expected before launch): private key for
  non-interactive public-key auth. Ask for this first in remediation; prefer it
  over the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` agent-socket fallback.
- **SLURM_BASE_RESULTS_DIR** (optional): base shared-filesystem path; default
  `/lustre/fsw/portfolios/edgeai/users/<your-dir>` (your per-user Lustre dir).
- **SLURM_ACCOUNT** (usually required by site policy): account for `#SBATCH --account`.

Do not ask for `SLURM_ACCOUNT` or `SLURM_BASE_RESULTS_DIR` in the initial
intake unless the user says their site requires an account, wants a custom
results root, or the workflow cannot proceed without overriding defaults.

## Resource defaults

Defaults from `tao-core`:

- `num_nodes`: 1
- `num_gpus`: 4
- `max_num_gpus_per_node`: 8
- `cpus_per_task`: 16
- `time_hours`: 4
- `timeout_hours`: 3.8
- `max_time_hours`: 4
- `container_mounts`: `/lustre`
- `use_requeue`: true
- `use_sqsh`: true

When generating launchers or wrapper scripts for SLURM, set the wall-time
defaults explicitly from the packaged platform resource defaults:

```bash
export SLURM_TIME_HOURS="${SLURM_TIME_HOURS:-4}"
export SLURM_TIMEOUT_HOURS="${SLURM_TIMEOUT_HOURS:-3.8}"
```

Do not default to 12 hours on SLURM. If the user supplies a longer
`SLURM_TIME_HOURS`, verify that the selected partition supports it before
submitting. For the packaged default partition list
`polar,polar3,polar4,grizzly`, reject requests above 4 hours and ask for a
different partition only if the user actually wants a longer wall time.

When `num_gpus` is greater than or equal to `max_num_gpus_per_node`, the
handler treats the request as exclusive per node and computes additional nodes
from total GPU count when necessary.

## Multi-node and retries

For multi-node jobs (`num_nodes > 1`), the rendered
`templates/slurm/multinode.sbatch.tmpl` sets the sbatch directives and exports
the PyTorch-distributed rendezvous env vars: `WORLD_SIZE`, `NUM_GPU_PER_NODE`,
`NODE_RANK`, `MASTER_ADDR`, and `MASTER_PORT` (29500). TAO entrypoints read
`WORLD_SIZE` + `NUM_GPU_PER_NODE` and build torchrun internally. Cosmos-RL has
special multi-node role handling for controller, policy, and rollout workers.
See the `### Multi-node (nodes > 1)` submit subsection above for the NCCL-probe
gate and per-cluster env caching.

**Use Lustre, not S3, for SLURM job inputs.** The GPU allocation starts the
moment the job is dispatched, so a long `s3://` download at the top of the
script burns the allocation, can get the job killed for GPU-idle, and is billed
either way. Stage training data on the shared filesystem first and reference it
as `lustre:///...`. S3/HF/NGC pre-fetch is fine for small auxiliary inputs
(checkpoints, configs), not training datasets. K8s/Brev do not share this
scheduler-idle constraint.

On an infrastructure failure (`NODE_FAIL`, `BOOT_FAIL`, NCCL transport timeouts,
CUDA driver init failures, GPU/IB link-down, OOM-killer node reaping, Xid
errors), classify infra-vs-program from the logs and re-submit the staged sbatch
script (M6). Plain training failures surface immediately so a broken spec does
not consume the retry budget. `#SBATCH --requeue` is enabled by default via
`SLURM_USE_REQUEUE=true`, so SLURM itself re-queues the job on `NODE_FAIL` or
pre-emption before any agent-level resubmit.

See `references/slurm-container-execution.md` for the full multi-node
env-var/sbatch directive detail and table, cluster requirements, the
Lustre-not-S3 rule in full, and the failure-mode checklist.
