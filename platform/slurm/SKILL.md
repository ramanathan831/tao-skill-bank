description: Remote SLURM GPU cluster execution over SSH with sbatch/srun, Pyxis/Enroot containers, and Lustre-backed results.
  Use when running TAO jobs on an on-prem or DGX SLURM cluster.
license: Apache-2.0
compatibility: Requires SSH access to a SLURM login node (passwordless via key auth) and SLURM_USER + SLURM_HOSTNAME env vars.
  The TAO SDK with the slurm extra (pip install 'nvidia-tao-sdk[slurm]') is needed only if you want Job handles, S3 I/O wrapping,
  or run-folder durability via ActionWorkflow.

## Preflight

```bash
# 1. SSH to the login node works without a password prompt
SLURM_HOST="${SLURM_HOSTNAME%%,*}"
[ -n "$SLURM_USER" ] && [ -n "$SLURM_HOST" ] || {
  echo "MISSING: set SLURM_USER and SLURM_HOSTNAME (comma-separated for failover) in your env (~/.config/tao/.env)."
  exit 1
}
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=10 "${SLURM_USER}@${SLURM_HOST}" "true" 2>/dev/null || {
  echo "MISSING: passwordless SSH to ${SLURM_USER}@${SLURM_HOST} not working. See the Prerequisites section."
  exit 1
}

# 2. Optional: TAO SDK wrapper for Job handles + S3 wrapping.
# nvidia-tao-sdk is not on public PyPI yet — install from the GitLab repo:
REPO='git+https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/nvidia-tao-toolkit/tao-sdk.git'
python -c "import tao_sdk" 2>/dev/null || {
  echo "MISSING: nvidia-tao-sdk not installed. Run:"
  echo "  pip install \"nvidia-tao-sdk[slurm] @ $REPO\""
  exit 1
}
```

If a check fails, the agent prompts the user to authorize the install/fix via Bash.

# SLURM

Remote GPU compute platform for clusters managed by SLURM. Jobs are submitted
from the TAO service or SDK host to a login node over SSH, staged on a shared
filesystem, submitted with `sbatch`, and executed with `srun` container support.

Use SLURM when the user has access to a managed GPU cluster, shared Lustre
storage, and scheduler-owned GPU allocation. Do not use SLURM for local files
that exist only on the agent machine; data and outputs must be reachable from
the cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before any SLURM job can be submitted or any runner script is generated, the
host running the TAO service or SDK must be able to log in to at least one host
from `SLURM_HOSTNAME` over SSH **without an interactive password prompt**. The
handler runs `sbatch`, `squeue`, `sacct`, `scancel`, and log tails
non-interactively, so password or 2FA prompts will fail the job at submit or
status time.

Set this up once per (host, login node, user) tuple:

1. Ensure an SSH keypair exists for the service user (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
   Create one with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` if it is
   missing. The handler defaults to the same locations described under
   `SSH_KEY_PATH` in [Credentials](#credentials).
2. Install the public key on each login node:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <SLURM_USER>@<login-host>
   ```

   This is the only step that requires the user's password; run it interactively
   once per login host listed in `SLURM_HOSTNAME`. If `ssh-copy-id` is not
   available, append the public key manually:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh <SLURM_USER>@<login-host> \
     'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && \
      cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
   ```
3. Trust the host key so SSH does not stall on the "authenticity of host" prompt
   inside the handler. Either log in once interactively to accept the prompt,
   or pre-populate `~/.ssh/known_hosts` with `ssh-keyscan -H <login-host> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
4. Verify the result is fully non-interactive for at least one listed login
   host:

   ```bash
   ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey \
     <SLURM_USER>@<login-host> 'hostname && squeue -u $USER -h | head -n 1'
   ```

   `BatchMode=yes` forces failure if SSH would otherwise prompt; this command
   must succeed before the SLURM platform is usable.
5. When the service runs in a container (microservices deployment), mount the
   private key into the container at the path referenced by `SSH_KEY_PATH`, with
   `chmod 600` and matching ownership for the in-container user. The handler
   refuses keys with world-readable permissions.

For convenience, a per-host alias in `~/.ssh/config` lets you reference a short
name everywhere:

```text
Host slurm-login
    HostName <login-host>
    User <SLURM_USER>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
```

If a site enforces 2FA on every SSH connection, passwordless key auth alone is
not enough; coordinate with the cluster admin to allow key-only auth from the
service host or use an SSH agent with cached credentials and expose it to the
handler via `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.

## Credentials

- **SLURM_USER** (required): SSH username for the login node. In microservices
  workspace metadata this is `cloud_specific_details.slurm_user`.
- **SLURM_HOSTNAME** (required): Comma-separated login hostnames for failover.
  Microservices schema stores this as the list field
  `cloud_specific_details.slurm_hostname`.
- **SLURM_PARTITION** (required): Partition list for GPU job submission. Ask
  for this in the mandatory SLURM intake list. The packaged default is
  `polar,polar3,polar4,grizzly`, which are treated as 4-hour queues.
- **SSH_KEY_PATH** (preferred and expected before launch): private key path for
  non-interactive public-key auth to the login node. If passwordless SSH fails,
  ask the user for `SSH_KEY_PATH=/path/to/private_key` and show the setup steps
  below; do not bury this behind several alternate choices.
- **SSH_AUTH_SOCK** (advanced fallback): SSH agent socket with an accepted key
  already loaded. Prefer `SSH_KEY_PATH` in user-facing remediation prompts.
- **SLURM_BASE_RESULTS_DIR** (optional): Base shared filesystem path. Default
  convention from `tao-core` is `/lustre/fsw/portfolios/edgeai/users/<user>`.
- **SLURM_ACCOUNT** (usually required by site policy): Account charged by
  `#SBATCH --account`.

Do not ask for `SLURM_ACCOUNT` or `SLURM_BASE_RESULTS_DIR` in the initial
intake unless the user says their site requires an account, wants a custom
results root, or the workflow cannot proceed without overriding defaults.

## Backend Details

Use `backend_details.backend_type = "slurm"` when routing a job to this
platform. Supported backend details from the microservices schema:

```json
{
  "backend_type": "slurm",
  "partition": "polar,polar3,polar4,grizzly",
  "cluster_name": "optional-name"
}
```

Runtime metadata is stored under `backend_details.slurm_metadata`, especially
`slurm_job_id` and `job_dir`. Do not invent these values. They are written
after `sbatch` returns a scheduler job id.

## Storage

SLURM jobs run on the cluster, so local paths from the API host are not valid
dataset paths. Prefer shared filesystem URIs:

- Use `lustre:///absolute/path` for user-provided datasets on Lustre.
- `slurm://` paths may appear in microservices metadata and are converted to
  actual Lustre paths before the container starts.
- Avoid bare `/local/path` and `file://` dataset URIs for SLURM. Validation in
  `tao-core` rejects local and file paths for remote backends.

Accept either dataset roots or direct spec-key paths:

- Root mode: `/lustre/.../<model>/train`, which model skills map to required
  files such as `<root>/annotations.json` and `<root>` as media path.
- Direct spec mode: exact fields such as
  `custom.train_dataset.annotation_path=/lustre/.../train.json` and
  `custom.train_dataset.media_path=/lustre/.../videos.tar.gz`.

After passwordless SSH succeeds and before generating scripts, validate each
required dataset file/path from the login host:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes <SLURM_USER>@<working-login-host> \
  'test -e /lustre/.../annotations.json && test -e /lustre/.../media_or_archive'
```

If the remote `test -e` fails, stop and ask for corrected paths or for the data
to be staged onto shared cluster storage. Do not create runner scripts that will
fail inside the first training job.

## SSH Failure Remediation Prompt

When passwordless SSH fails, use this concise prompt:

```text
SLURM is blocked on passwordless SSH. Please provide:

SSH_KEY_PATH=/path/to/private_key

If you have not set up passwordless access yet:
1. Create a key if needed:
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
2. Install the public key on one login host:
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <SLURM_USER>@<login-host>
3. Trust the host key:
   ssh-keyscan -H <login-host> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
4. Lock private-key permissions:
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
5. Verify it works without prompts:
   ssh -o BatchMode=yes -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 <SLURM_USER>@<login-host> 'hostname'

After that, rerun with SSH_KEY_PATH=~/.ssh/id_ed25519.
```

Results default to:

```text
/lustre/fsw/portfolios/edgeai/users/<slurm_user>/results/<job_id>
```

The runner sets `TAO_API_RESULTS_DIR` to the parent results directory because
container code appends the job id when writing status and artifacts.

## Container Execution

`tao-core` uses the SLURM handler to run TAO containers through Pyxis/Enroot:

1. Stage compact JSON files for specs, environment, and cloud metadata under
   `<job_dir>/specs`, `<job_dir>/env`, and `<job_dir>/meta`.
2. Optionally convert the Docker image to a cached SQSH image with
   `srun -n1 -p <conversion_partition> enroot import`.
3. Write an sbatch script under `<job_dir>/sbatch/job_<job_id>.sbatch`.
4. Submit `sbatch --export=ALL <script>`.
5. Run the container with `srun --container-image=<image> --container-mounts=/lustre`.

Image formats accepted by the handler:

- `/path/to/image.sqsh`
- `registry#image:tag`
- `docker://registry#image:tag`
- ordinary `registry/image:tag`, which is converted to Pyxis form when needed

SQSH conversion is cached by image name. For `:latest` images, cached SQSH is
used unless `force_reconvert_latest` is enabled.

## Resource Mapping

Defaults from `tao-core`:

- `num_nodes`: 1
- `num_gpus`: 4
- `max_num_gpus_per_node`: 8
- `cpus_per_task`: 16
- `time_hours`: 4
- `timeout_hours`: 3.8
- `max_time_hours`: 4
- `container_mounts`: `/lustre`
- `use_requeue`: true
- `use_sqsh`: true

When generating launchers or wrapper scripts for SLURM, set the wall-time
defaults explicitly from the packaged platform resource defaults:

```bash
export SLURM_TIME_HOURS="${SLURM_TIME_HOURS:-4}"
export SLURM_TIMEOUT_HOURS="${SLURM_TIMEOUT_HOURS:-3.8}"
```

Do not default to 12 hours on SLURM. If the user supplies a longer
`SLURM_TIME_HOURS`, verify that the selected partition supports it before
submitting. For the packaged default partition list
`polar,polar3,polar4,grizzly`, reject requests above 4 hours and ask for a
different partition only if the user actually wants a longer wall time.

When `num_gpus` is greater than or equal to `max_num_gpus_per_node`, the
handler treats the request as exclusive per node and computes additional nodes
from total GPU count when necessary.

For multi-node jobs, the sbatch script exports `WORLD_SIZE`, `MASTER_ADDR`,
`MASTER_PORT`, `NODE_RANK`, and `NUM_GPU_PER_NODE`. Cosmos-RL has special
multi-node role handling for controller, policy, and rollout workers.

## Monitoring

- Scheduler status comes from the stored SLURM job id via `squeue` or `sacct`.
- TAO terminal status comes from `status.json` in the shared results folder.
- If the user enabled chat monitoring, continue polling at the requested
  interval while the job is `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, or otherwise non-terminal.
  Do not stop after a fixed elapsed time such as 30 minutes; long queue waits
  are normal on shared GPU partitions.
- Do not send a final response for a non-terminal SLURM job when chat
  monitoring is enabled. A final response is a detach action; use it only if
  the user asked to detach/stop or the job reached terminal state.
- Logs are read over SSH from:

```text
<job_dir>/slurm-logs/<slurm_job_name>-<slurm_job_id>/main.out
<job_dir>/slurm-logs/<slurm_job_name>-<slurm_job_id>/main.err
```

Status mapping:

- `PENDING` -> `Pending`
- `RUNNING` or `COMPLETING` -> `Running`
- `COMPLETED` -> check `status.json`
- `FAILED`, `BOOT_FAIL`, `DEADLINE`, `OUT_OF_MEMORY`, `NODE_FAIL` -> retry if
  logs match retriable infrastructure patterns, otherwise `Error`
- `CANCELLED`, `PREEMPTED`, `REVOKED` -> `Canceled`
- `TIMEOUT` -> `Error`
- `SUSPENDED`, `STOPPED` -> `Paused`

## Cancellation

Cancel by looking up `backend_details.slurm_metadata.slurm_job_id` and running
`scancel <slurm_job_id>` over SSH. Treat missing or already terminated SLURM
jobs as successful cancellation.

## Multi-node training (distributed)

SLURM is the platform of choice for large multi-node runs — pass `num_nodes > 1` and the SDK handles the sbatch directives + PyTorch-distributed env vars automatically.

```python
job = sdk.create_job(
    image='nvcr.io/nvidia/tao/tao-toolkit:6.26.3-pyt',
    command='torchrun --nnodes=$WORLD_SIZE --nproc-per-node=$NUM_GPU_PER_NODE '
            '--node-rank=$NODE_RANK --master-addr=$MASTER_ADDR --master-port=$MASTER_PORT '
            'train.py',
    gpu_count=8,           # GPUs per node
    num_nodes=4,           # 4 × 8 = 32 GPUs total
    inputs={'/data/train.json': 'lustre:///lustre/.../coco/train.json'},
    outputs=['/results/'],
)
```

### What the SDK generates

The handler builds an `sbatch` script with:

```
#SBATCH --nodes=N                    # node count
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1          # one container per node (Pyxis spawns the GPU procs inside)
#SBATCH --ntasks=N                   # total tasks across the job
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:G                 # G GPUs per node
#SBATCH --wait-all-nodes=1           # don't start until all N nodes are allocated
```

Then exports the rendezvous env vars before `srun --container-image=...` launches the container on each node. These match the TAO PyTorch container contract (`nvidia_tao_pytorch/core/entrypoint.py`):

| Env var | Value | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `WORLD_SIZE` | `N` (= node count, TAO's misnamed convention) | TAO container entrypoint |
| `NUM_GPU_PER_NODE` | `G` | TAO container entrypoint |
| `NODE_RANK` | `$SLURM_NODEID` | TAO container entrypoint, torchrun |
| `MASTER_ADDR` | first hostname from `scontrol show hostname $SLURM_JOB_NODELIST` | TAO container entrypoint, torchrun |
| `MASTER_PORT` | `29500` | TAO container entrypoint, torchrun |

```bash
export WORLD_SIZE=N
export NUM_GPU_PER_NODE=G
export MASTER_PORT=29500
NODELIST=$(scontrol show hostname $SLURM_JOB_NODELIST)
export MASTER_ADDR=$(echo $NODELIST | cut -d' ' -f1)   # first node = rank-0 / master
export NODE_RANK=$SLURM_NODEID                          # SLURM provides this per-node
```

`SLURM_JOB_NODELIST` and `SLURM_NODEID` come from SLURM itself — no manual registration step.

For TAO entrypoints (`dino train -e spec.yaml`, etc.) the container's entrypoint reads `WORLD_SIZE` + `NUM_GPU_PER_NODE` and constructs the torchrun command internally. For raw `torchrun` commands, use the standard PyTorch flags pointing at these env vars.

### Cluster requirements for multi-node

- **Pyxis + Enroot** must be installed on the cluster for `srun --container-image` to work. (Standard on DGX SuperPOD; check with your cluster admin elsewhere.)
- **InfiniBand / NVLink** is recommended for performance — set `NCCL_IB_HCA`, `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` via `env_vars` if the defaults don't pick the right interface.
- **Shared filesystem** (Lustre) for staging the entrypoint script, env files, and results. Set `SLURM_BASE_RESULTS_DIR`.

## Optional: via the TAO SDK

The SDK install is covered in [Preflight](#preflight) — `pip install
'nvidia-tao-sdk[slurm]'`. Use it when you want Job handles, the
sbatch/`squeue`/`sacct` plumbing handled for you, run-folder durability via
`ActionWorkflow`, **or convenient cloud-storage I/O** (the SDK's
`build_entrypoint` inlines `script_runner` and dispatches `s3://`,
`hf_model://`, and `ngc://` URIs to the right downloader; without the SDK you
either pre-stage the data on Lustre or call `fsspec` / `huggingface-cli`
yourself).

> **Use Lustre, not S3, for SLURM job inputs.** SLURM's scheduler enforces a
> GPU-idle timeout: the GPU allocation starts the moment your job is
> dispatched, and a long `s3://` download at the top of the script will burn
> minutes (or tens of minutes for large datasets) before training begins. The
> scheduler can kill the job for being GPU-idle, and the cluster bills you for
> the wasted allocation either way. Stage data onto the cluster's shared
> filesystem first and reference it as `lustre:///...` (or a plain absolute
> path the compute nodes can read). S3 / HF / NGC pre-fetch is fine for *small*
> auxiliary inputs (model checkpoints, configs); avoid it for training
> datasets. Lepton/K8s/Brev don't have this constraint because they don't
> share SLURM's scheduler-idle policy.

```python
from tao_sdk.platforms.slurm import SlurmSDK
from tao_sdk.script_runner import build_entrypoint

ep = build_entrypoint(
    command='dino train -e {config_path}',
    specs=specs,                                           # config-mode (spec rewriting)
    job_id='dino-train-1',
)

sdk = SlurmSDK()  # reads SLURM_USER, SLURM_HOSTNAME, SLURM_BASE_RESULTS_DIR from env
job = sdk.create_job(
    image='nvcr.io/nvidia/tao/tao-toolkit:6.26.3-pyt',
    command=ep['command'],
    gpu_count=8,
    num_nodes=2,                                           # multi-node supported
    partition='batch',                                     # optional override
    account='myproject',                                   # optional override
)

status = sdk.get_job_status(job.id)
logs = sdk.get_job_logs(job.id, tail=200)
```

The SDK takes care of staging the entrypoint script to Lustre, generating the
`sbatch` script with Pyxis `srun --container-image`, and parsing
`squeue`/`sacct` for status. Without the SDK, drive `sbatch` and `srun`
yourself.

### Auto-retry for infrastructure failures

Auto-retry is **fully automatic** — submit once, the SDK handles the rest. A
background `JobMonitor` thread (started in `SlurmSDK.__init__`) polls
`squeue`/`sacct` every `poll_interval` seconds (default 30s). When it sees an
*infrastructure-looking* failure it re-`sbatch`'s the already-staged remote
script and keeps watching, up to `MAX_JOB_RETRIES = 10` retries. The
user-facing `Job.id` is stable across retries; only the underlying SLURM job
id rotates. There is no `Job.retry()` / `Job.wait()` API to call — polling
and resubmission both happen in the background.

A failure is classified as retriable when:

- SLURM reports `NODE_FAIL` or `BOOT_FAIL`, **or**
- The job's logs match one of the retriable patterns (NCCL transport timeouts,
  CUDA driver init failures, GPU/IB link-down, OOM-killer reaping the node, et
  cetera — see `RETRIABLE_ERROR_PATTERNS` in the handler).

Plain training failures (`FAILED` with no matching pattern) are surfaced
immediately — no retry — so a broken spec doesn't silently consume 10 GPU
allocations.

State is persisted to `tao_session_state.db`, so if the user's process exits
between submit and completion, a later `SlurmSDK(state_file=...)` rehydrates
the job and resumes monitoring (and retrying) from where the previous process
left off.

In addition, `#SBATCH --requeue` is set by default (controlled by the
`SLURM_USE_REQUEUE` env var, defaults to `true`), so SLURM itself will
re-queue the job on `NODE_FAIL` or pre-emption *before* the handler-level
retry loop ever sees it. Set `SLURM_USE_REQUEUE=false` to opt out.

## Failure Modes

**SSH auth failure**: The passwordless-login setup in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
is incomplete. Check `SLURM_USER`, `SLURM_HOSTNAME`, `SSH_KEY_PATH`, key
permissions (`chmod 600`), `known_hosts` entries for every login host, and
whether the key is mounted into the service container. Re-run the
`ssh -o BatchMode=yes ...` verification step from the Prerequisites section to
confirm the fix before resubmitting.

**Local dataset path rejected**: Convert the data path to `lustre:///...` or
copy the dataset onto the cluster's shared filesystem.

**SQSH conversion timeout**: Increase `sqsh_conversion_timeout_minutes`, use a
smaller image, or pre-stage the SQSH image in the cache directory.

**Pyxis or Enroot unavailable**: The generated sbatch script depends on
`srun --container-image`. Ask the cluster admin to enable Pyxis/Enroot or use a
different platform.

**Bad node or transient GPU failure**: The handler retries infrastructure-like
failures such as CUDA driver errors, missing GPUs, NCCL/RDMA failures, Xid
errors, and node failures up to the configured retry limit.
